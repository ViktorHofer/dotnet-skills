# MSBuild Agentic Workflow Templates

These are [GitHub Agentic Workflow](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) templates for MSBuild and .NET build automation.

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `build-failure-analysis.md` | CI build fails | Analyzes build failures and posts diagnostic comments on PRs |
| `msbuild-pr-review.md` | PR with MSBuild file changes | Reviews MSBuild project file changes for best practices |
| `build-perf-audit.md` | Weekly schedule | Runs build performance audit and creates issues for regressions |

## Shared Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `shared/binlog-mcp.md` | Configures the MSBuild binary log MCP server for analysis |
| `shared/compiled/` | Compiled skill knowledge (generated by `eng/compile-knowledge.js`) |

## Setup

1. Install the `gh aw` CLI extension
2. **Generate compiled knowledge** (from the repo root):
   ```bash
   node eng/compile-knowledge.js agentic-workflows
   ```
3. Copy the desired workflow files to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
4. Copy the `shared/` directory as well (workflows import from it)
5. Compile: `gh aw compile`
6. Commit both the `.md` and generated `.lock.yml` files
7. The workflows will now run automatically based on their triggers

## Customization

- Edit the `on:` section to match your CI workflow names
- Adjust `safe-outputs` limits as needed
- Rerun `node eng/compile-knowledge.js agentic-workflows` after skill changes
