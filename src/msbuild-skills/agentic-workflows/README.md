# MSBuild Agentic Workflow Templates

These are [GitHub Agentic Workflow](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) templates for MSBuild and .NET build automation.

## Setup

1. Install the `gh aw` CLI extension
2. **Generate compiled knowledge** (from the repo root):
   ```bash
   node src/msbuild-skills/build.js
   ```
3. Copy the desired workflow files to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
4. Copy the `shared/` directory as well (workflows import from it)
5. Compile: `gh aw compile`
6. Commit both the `.md` and generated `.lock.yml` files
7. The workflows will now run automatically based on their triggers

## Customization

- Edit the `on:` section to match your CI workflow names
- Adjust `safe-outputs` limits as needed
- Rerun `node src/msbuild-skills/build.js` after skill changes
