# Create Template from Existing Project

Help me create a reusable `dotnet new` template from one of my existing projects. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the project**: Ask which .csproj file to use as the source
2. **Analyze**: Use `template_create_from_existing` to analyze the project and generate template files
3. **Review gaps**: Show the gaps report — what the generated template covers vs. what it can't capture automatically
4. **Refine**: Help me add parameters, conditional sections, or post-actions as needed
5. **Test**: Install the template locally and verify it works with a dry-run and test creation
