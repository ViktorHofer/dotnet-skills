# Analyzing MSBuild Failures with Binary Logs

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Invocation Rules

**This skill is a BLOCKING REQUIREMENT when any .NET build fails.** You MUST invoke this skill when:
- `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, `msbuild`, or any MSBuild-based command exits with non-zero code
- Console output contains "Build failed", "error CS", "error MSB", or similar build errors
- Any .NET compilation or restore operation fails

**What you MUST NOT do:**
- Do NOT report build errors directly from console output to the user
- Do NOT attempt to fix errors based on console output alone
- Do NOT skip this skill because "the errors look simple"

**Correct behavior:** Invoke this skill → analyze with binlog-mcp tools → then report findings and suggest fixes.

**Fallback:** Only if the binlog-mcp tools fail to provide useful information (e.g., binlog not generated, tools return errors, or analysis is inconclusive), you may fall back to analyzing console output directly. Always attempt binlog analysis first.

When an MSBuild build fails, use the binlog-mcp tool to deeply analyze the failure. This skill guides you through generating a binary log and using the MCP tools to diagnose issues.

## Step 1: Generate a Binary Log

Re-run the failed build command with the `/bl` flag to generate a binary log file:

```bash
# For dotnet builds
dotnet build /bl

# For msbuild directly
msbuild /bl

# Custom binlog filename
dotnet build /bl:build.binlog
```

The `/bl` flag tells MSBuild to generate a `msbuild.binlog` file (or the specified filename) in the current directory.

## Step 2: Load the Binary Log

Use the `load_binlog` tool to load the generated binlog file:

```
load_binlog with path: "<absolute-path-to-binlog>"
```

This must be called before using any other binlog analysis tools.

## Step 3: Analyze the Failure

### Get Diagnostics (Errors and Warnings)

Use `get_diagnostics` to extract all errors and warnings:

```
get_diagnostics with:
  - binlog_file: "<path>"
  - includeErrors: true
  - includeWarnings: true
  - includeDetails: true
```

This returns detailed diagnostic information including file paths, line numbers, and context.

### Search for Specific Issues

Use `search_binlog` with the powerful query language to find specific issues:

```
search_binlog with:
  - binlog_file: "<path>"
  - query: "error CS1234"        # Find specific error codes
  - query: "$task Csc"           # Find all C# compilation tasks
  - query: "under($project MyProject)"  # Find nodes under a specific project
```

### Investigate Expensive Operations

If the build is slow or timing out:

```
get_expensive_targets with binlog_file and top_number: 10
get_expensive_tasks with binlog_file and top_number: 10
get_expensive_projects with binlog_file and top_number: 10
```

### Analyze Roslyn Analyzers

If compilation is slow, check analyzer performance:

```
get_expensive_analyzers with binlog_file and top_number: 10
```

## Common Analysis Workflows

### Build Error Investigation
1. `load_binlog` - Load the binlog
2. `get_diagnostics` with `includeErrors: true` - Get all errors
3. `search_binlog` with the error code - Find context around the error
4. `list_projects` - Identify which projects are involved
5. `get_file_from_binlog` - View source files embedded in the binlog

### Performance Investigation
1. `load_binlog` - Load the binlog
2. `get_expensive_targets` - Find slow targets
3. `get_expensive_tasks` - Find slow tasks
4. `search_targets_by_name` - Find all executions of a specific target
5. `get_node_timeline` - Analyze parallelism and node utilization

### Dependency/Evaluation Issues
1. `load_binlog` - Load the binlog
2. `list_projects` - See all projects in the build
3. `list_evaluations` - Check for multiple evaluations (indicates overbuilding)
4. `get_evaluation_global_properties` - Compare properties between evaluations

## Query Language Reference

The `search_binlog` tool supports powerful query syntax:

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"error CS1234"` | Exact text match |
| `$task Copy` | Find all Copy tasks |
| `$target CoreCompile` | Find all CoreCompile target executions |
| `$project MyProject` | Find nodes related to MyProject |
| `under($project X)` | Find nodes under project X |
| `name=Configuration value=Debug` | Find property nodes |
| `skipped=true` | Find skipped targets |

## Tips

- The binlog contains embedded source files - use `list_files_from_binlog` and `get_file_from_binlog` to view them
- Use `maxResults` parameter to limit large result sets
- The binlog captures the complete build state, making it ideal for reproducing and diagnosing issues
