# MSBuild Skills for AI Assistants

This repository provides comprehensive MSBuild and .NET build expertise for AI assistants including [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), and [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.com/github/gh-aw).

## What's Included

### 🔧 Skills (Knowledge Base)

Skills are AI-readable reference documents that provide deep expertise on specific topics.

#### Build Failure Troubleshooting
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `common-build-errors` | Catalog of CS, MSB, NU, NETSDK errors with root causes and step-by-step fixes |
| `nuget-restore-failures` | NuGet restore diagnosis: feed auth, version conflicts, source mapping, lock files |
| `sdk-workload-resolution` | SDK and workload resolution: global.json, roll-forward policies, workload management |
| `multitarget-tfm-issues` | TFM compatibility, multi-targeting setup, conditional compilation, RID issues |
| `binlog-failure-analysis` | Binary log analysis for deep build failure diagnosis |
| `binlog-generation` | Binary log generation conventions |

#### Build Performance Optimization
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `build-perf-diagnostics` | Performance bottleneck identification using binlog analysis |
| `incremental-build` | Incremental build optimization: Inputs/Outputs, FileWrites, up-to-date checks |
| `build-parallelism` | Parallelism tuning: /maxcpucount, graph build, project dependency optimization |
| `build-caching` | Build caching: NuGet cache, VBCSCompiler, deterministic builds, CI/CD strategies |
| `eval-performance` | Evaluation performance: glob optimization, import chain analysis |

#### Code Quality & Modernization
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `msbuild-style-guide` | Best practices for idiomatic MSBuild: naming, conditions, targets, property functions |
| `msbuild-modernization` | Legacy to SDK-style project migration with before/after examples |
| `directory-build-organization` | Directory.Build.props/targets/rsp organization and central package management |
| `check-bin-obj-clash` | Output path conflict detection for multi-targeting and multi-project builds |
| `including-generated-files` | Including build-generated files in MSBuild's build process |

#### Other
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `msbuild-domain-check` | Domain relevance gating — ensures MSBuild skills only activate in .NET contexts |
| `multithreaded-task-migration` | Thread-safe MSBuild task migration guide |

### 🤖 Custom Agents

Agents are autonomous AI personas that orchestrate multi-step workflows.

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `msbuild` | General MSBuild expert — triages problems and routes to specialized skills/agents |
| `build-perf` | Build performance analyst — runs builds, analyzes binlogs, suggests optimizations |
| `msbuild-code-review` | Project file reviewer — scans .csproj/.props/.targets for anti-patterns and improvements |

### 📦 Distribution Templates

Ready-to-use templates for different distribution channels:

| Template | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Agent Instructions | `templates/AGENTS.md` | Copy to repo root as `AGENTS.md` for cross-agent MSBuild guidance |
| Prompt Files | `templates/prompts/` | Copy to `.github/prompts/` for VS Code Copilot Chat workflows |
| Agentic Workflows | `templates/agentic-workflows/` | Copy to `.github/workflows/` for CI-integrated MSBuild automation |
| Copilot Extension Design | `templates/copilot-extension-design.md` | Design doc for a future Copilot Extension |

## Installation

### Copilot CLI / Claude Code

1. Launch Copilot CLI or Claude Code
2. Add the marketplace:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add ViktorHofer/dotnet-skills
   ```
3. Install the plugin:
   ```
   /plugin install msbuild-skills@dotnet-skills
   ```
4. Restart to load the new skills
5. View available skills:
   ```
   /skills
   ```

### Agent Instructions (Zero Install)

Copy `templates/AGENTS.md` to your repository root:
```bash
cp templates/AGENTS.md AGENTS.md
```
This provides MSBuild awareness in Copilot, Claude Code, and other agents that support the `AGENTS.md` standard.

### VS Code Prompt Files

Copy the prompt templates to your repository:
```bash
mkdir -p .github/prompts
cp templates/prompts/*.prompt.md .github/prompts/
```
Use them in Copilot Chat with `#prompt` references.

### Agentic Workflows

Copy the workflow templates and compile with `gh aw`:
```bash
cp -r templates/agentic-workflows/ .github/workflows/
gh aw compile
git add .github/workflows/
```

## Updating
